# Data-Structures and Algorithms in Golang [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dansackett/algorithms.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dansackett/algorithms)

In an effort to learn more Golang and understand computer science concepts
better, I'm pairing the two in order to multiply my efforts. This repo's
design is based off that of [arnauddri](https://github.com/arnauddri/algorithms).
I merely took the structure and CS concepts as reference and ignored the
actual implementations.

## What I Want to Learn

* How to write Idiomatic Golang code
* How to write tests for Golang code
* How to implement common data structures
* Which algorithms are most efficient for sorting / searching
