# Iterator Design Pattern

the iterator pattern is a design pattern in which an iterator is used to
traverse a container and access the container's elements. The iterator pattern
decouples algorithms from containers; in some cases, algorithms are necessarily
container-specific and thus cannot be decoupled.
