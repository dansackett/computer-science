# Adpater Design Pattern

Adapter pattern works as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces. This
type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern combines
the capability of two independent interfaces.

This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to join
functionalities of independent or incompatible interfaces. A real life example
could be a case of card reader which acts as an adapter between memory card and
a laptop. You plugin the memory card into card reader and card reader into the
laptop so that memory card can be read via laptop.
