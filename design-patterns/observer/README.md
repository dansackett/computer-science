# Observer Design Pattern

The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called
the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies
them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their
methods. It is mainly used to implement distributed event handling systems. The
Observer pattern is also a key part in the familiar model–view–controller (MVC)
architectural pattern.
